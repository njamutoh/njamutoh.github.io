            <h2>Chicken</h2>
            <div id="text1">
                Chicken is the ubiquitous food of our era, crossing multiple 
                cultural boundaries with ease. With its mild taste and uniform
                texture, chicken presents an intriguingly blank canvas for the
                flavor palette of almost any cuisine. A generation of Britons is
                coming of age in the belief that chicken tikka masala is the
                national dish, and the same thing is happening in China with 
                Kentucky Fried Chicken.

            <h3>Beef</h3>
            <div id="text2">
                Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric
                times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since
                that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically
                for the quality or quantity of their meat.I'm a large scale meat
                consumer though.Can't see myself living without meat.Vegeterianism
                is senseless for me.

            <div id="text3">
                Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with
                some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such
                as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its
                presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice",
                also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.
